# What Is Quantum Computing? What is meant by the term Quantum Computing?

Let us first Understand the term Quantum Computing.

In physics, a quantum (plural quanta) is the minimum amount of any physical entity (physical property) involved in an interaction.

So to Understand that here is an example

For example, in physical terms, an electron has two possible quantum states: spin up & spin down.

Quantum computing is focused on developing computer technology based on the principles of Quantum Mechanics which explains the behavior of energy and material on the atomic and subatomic levels.

In simpler terms we can say

> Quantum computing is an area of study focused around the principles of quantum theory.

Or

> Quantum computing is a field comprising aspects of computer science, physics, and mathematics that utilizes quantum mechanics to solve complex problems

# Why do we need Quantum computing ?

As the Question arises why do we need Quantum computing we look further into this
Quantum Computing is gradually becoming a subject of interest among researchers and technology enthusiasts. These can lead us to breakthroughs in drug discovery, cybersecurity, cryptography ,banking & Finance. A report by McKinsey & Partner, predicts the field of quantum computing technology to have a global market value of US$1 trillion by 2035.

The main point is that classical computers cannot solve complex problems. Quantum Computing on the other hand can solve complex problems with  speed and has the potential to revolutionize The industry And it's not just their speed. Quantum computers can solve the kind of complex problems that regular computers are really bad at solving

Director of engineering at Google, Hartmut Neven, also noted that quantum computers could help build better climate models that could give us more insight into how humans are influencing the environment. Although Quantum computing is in itâ€™s initial development we can predict some amazing new development

Let's have a look at some examples Quantum computing will help us in solving complex problems more effectively over classical computing

# Conclusion

Quantum computers have the potential to revolutionize computation by making certain types of classically complex & tough problems solvable. While no quantum    computer is yet sophisticated enough to carry out calculations that a classical computer can't, great progress is underway.
