# What Is Quantum Computing?

In physics, a quantum (plural quanta) is the minimum amount of any physical entity (physical property) involved in an interaction.

So to understand that here is an example

**Light consists of photons. These photons represent the quantum of light that can be propapagated from one point in space to another.**

> Note; We will be adding some images with explanation for the bold senetences part

Quantum computing is focused on developing computational technology based on the principles of Quantum Mechanics.

In simpler terms we can say

> Quantum computing is an area of study focused around the principles of quantum theory and computing.

Or

> Quantum computing is a field comprising aspects of computer science, physics, and mathematics that utilizes quantum mechanics to solve complex computational problems.

# Why do we need Quantum Computing ?

As the Question arises why do we need Quantum computing we look further into this Quantum Computing is gradually becoming a subject of interest among researchers and technology enthusiasts. These can lead us to breakthroughs in drug discovery, cybersecurity, cryptography, fundamental physics, transport, finance.

The primary reasons researchers are interested in Quantum Computing is the potential speedup Quantum Computers could bring to many real-world computational problems. For example, searching through an unsorted collection of numbers takes `O(n)` time on a classical computer, whereas it takes `O(n^0.5)` time on a quantum computer. This speedup is huge and has immense applications in the fields of databases, information retrieval and more.

> `O(n)` is just a computer science way of saying that the time taken depends directly on `n`, which is the number of elements in the unsorted collection.

Director of engineering at Google, Hartmut Neven, also noted that quantum computers could help build better climate models that could give us more insight into how humans are influencing the environment. Although Quantum computing is in itâ€™s initial development we can predict some amazing new developments.
