# What Is Quantum Computing?

In physics, a quantum (plural quanta) is the minimum amount of any physical entity (physical property) involved in an interaction.

So to understand that here is an example

**Light consists of photons. A single photon is a discrete packet of light which cannot be broken down in smaller quantities. Light can be quantified as a given amount of these discrete packets. Hence, these photons represent the quantum of light that can be propapagated from one point in space to another .“A single photon is a discrete packet of light which cannot be broken down in smaller quantities. Light is can be quantified as a given
amount of these discrete packets.” Just to make it explicit that the photon is actually the minimum
quantity that is discussed..**

Quantum computing is focused on developing computational technology based on the principles of Quantum Mechanics.

In simpler terms, we can say that

> Quantum computing is an area of study focused around the principles of quantum theory and computing.

Or

> Quantum computing is a field comprising aspects of computer science, physics, and mathematics that utilizes quantum mechanics to solve complex computational problems.

# Why do we need Quantum Computing ?

Now the question arises, why do we need Quantum Computing ? We will now look further into this.

Quantum Computing is gradually becoming a subject of interest among researchers and technology enthusiasts. This is because it has to potential to lead us to breakthroughs in drug discovery, cybersecurity, cryptography, fundamental physics, transport, finance.

The primary reasons researchers are interested in Quantum Computing is the potential speedup Quantum Computers could bring to many real-world computational problems. For example, factoring a large integer `n` would take about `O(e^(log(n)^1/3))` operations to complete on a classical computer, whereas on a Quantum Computer, it would take exponentially fewer operations, `O(log(n)^2)`.

> `O(n)` is just a computer science way of saying that the time taken depends directly on `n`, which is the large integer we are trying to factor

This was proved by [Peter Shor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Shor) in 1994. It is now known as [Shor's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm) and has the potential to break down public-key encryption (the protocols that make sure our emails and text messages are secure) provided we can build a Quantum Computer with enough qubits.
Actually real-life applications of these are still unclear, and it is possible (many would argue
probable) that quadratic speedups (including the example you gave) wll actually ever lead to
quantum advantage and will have very little impact

team

The only real examples we know of so far that are both better complexity-wise and will have a
quantum advantage for real world use cases is [Shor’s algorithm](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn7293), and arguably machine learning
(given a special set of circumstances 

On a more constructive note, director of engineering at Google, Hartmut Neven, also noted that quantum computers could help build better climate models that could give us more insight into how humans are influencing the environment<sup>[1]</sup>. Although Quantum Computing is in it’s initial development we can predict some amazing new developments.

# How we can develop quantum awareness ?

# Conclusion

Quantum computers have the potential to revolutionize computation by making certain types of classically complex & tough problems solvable. While no quantum computer is yet sophisticated enough to carry out calculations that a classical computer can't, great progress is underway.
